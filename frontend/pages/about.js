      Embark on an exciting web development project using Express.js, Prisma, Postgres, and Next.js.
The backend, powered by Express.js and Prisma, handles the API and talks smoothly to the
database (Postgres). On the frontend, Next.js makes React even better by providing server-side
rendering and smart routing for a cool user experience. Key features include a user-friendly API,
strong security for logins, and access control.
